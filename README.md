Investment Planner

Banking customers are asked to enter the principal, the target interest rate and the duration of an investment. The application will then suggest suitable investment products as well as send the data to the database. Financial advisors of the bank can also log in to the website to browse the client data. Two SQL scripts are provided to build the databases locally.

User example: 

Client: username: simleung	password: abc123

Employee: username: kelvin66		password: abc123
